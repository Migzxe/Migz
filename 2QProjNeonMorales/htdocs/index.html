                    <span>What is Poverty?</span>
				
                    <p> According to Investopedia,"Poverty is a state or condition in which a person or community lacks the financial resources 
                    and essentials for a minimum standard of living. Poverty means that the income level from employment 
                    is so low that basic human needs can't be met." Poverty basically means to not have enough money for the basic needs of a human.
                    A lot of people experience this, around 9.2% of the world's population or 689 million people is experiencing this. We are pretty sure that
                    living in poverty is hard and something we wouldn't want to go through, just think of it like this, everything you've worked for suddenly disappeared, your money, cars or 
                    any material possessions and you're just left with 100 pesos or around 2 dollars to live on, it would be really hard. <b>What can we do to help reduce poverty?</b></p>
