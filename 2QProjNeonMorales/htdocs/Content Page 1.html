		            <h1>How Can We Help?<h1>
					<ul>
					<li>Donate</li>
					<p>This is the most common one that everybody already knows, you can donate on different charity websites
				    that give your donations to the poor. A lot of websites are present to help end poverty. By donating to help end poverty
			 	    you can help them become happy, you can change the life of a person! Donating is definitely a great way to help out.</p>
 				    <li> Give clothes you don't wear anymore!</li>
 				    <p> By giving your old clothes away that maybe doesn't fit you anymore or even just giving away your clothes, you can 
	 			    help out! With you not using them anymore someone out there could definitely use them and be thankful for them. Your old
					outfits that you think isn't good anymore, has another chance of getting worn! A lot of people will gratefully accept your clothes!</p>
					<li>Take some action on your own!</li>
					<p>What we mean on this is that you can fund a poor child's education, I know, I know not a lot of people will be willing to
				    fund a child's education because not everyone is rich, but if you can and you're willing to do this, happily do this, you can change
					a persons' life!</p>
					<li>Create Awareness About Poverty</li>
				    <p>Creating awareness about poverty is a great solution to try to get a lot of people on helping reduce poverty, by creating 
					awareness a lot of people may get into helping out. Also you can use social media to try and create awareness on this, since social 
				    media has been a part of our day to day lives, I really think that using it is a great idea to create awareness about it.</p>
					</ul>
